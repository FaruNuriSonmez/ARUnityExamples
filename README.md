# AR Unity Examples

Example projects that use [*AR Foundation 3.1*](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@3.1/manual/index.html) and [*AR Foundation 4.1*](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.1/manual/index.html) its functionality with sample assets and components.

# Examples

## ARCompass

This is a good starting sample that enables point cloud visualization and plane detection. There are buttons on screen that let you pause, resume, reset, and reload the ARSession.

When a plane is detected, you can tap on the detected plane to place a cube on it. This uses the `ARRaycastManager` to perform a raycast against the plane.
